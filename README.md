# Random-Music-Score-Generation

The aim of this project was to make the teaching process more scalable and iterative to give students as much practice and stimulation as possible in reading music. The music school did not have a scalable system and was only optimized to sell class hours so had to develop a scalable system to make the class setup more engaging.

The python code generates random music scores for practice in 4/4 time and perfect V-I cadence
